# Cypress Cucumber Tutorial

Learning Cucumber and BDD concepts with Cypress and the [cypress-cucumber-preprocessor](https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor) plugin.

## About (Work in Progress)

This repo is a learning ground for a few things:

- Behavior Driven Development Concepts
- Cucumber - a framework for writing and running BDD-style tests with Feature Files and Step Definitions
- Gherkin - a syntax for writing BDD features (Feature, Background, Example/Scenario, Given/When/Then, etc.)
- Using Cypress plugins
- Designing a test suite
